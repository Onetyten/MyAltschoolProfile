            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Labaeka Adetayo. I am a Back-End Engineering student at AltSchool Africa, and my goal is to become a full-stack app developer with knowledge of both front-end and back-end engineering. I was introduced to web development in 2018, but I did not start learning it professionally until a little over a year ago. Since then, I have been intrigued by the tech world. I studied Computer Engineering at Olabisi Onabanjo University, and I studied web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Python programming, at Aptech Computer Institute during my industrial training. Anything beyond that, such as React, TailwindCSS, and React Native, is self-taught. I have several hobbies, such as game development which is a very demanding hobby, and 3D modeling and animation, due to my desire to bring my thoughts and imaginations to life.

             <h2>Why i joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
             <p>
                I joined AltSchool Africa to deepen my understanding of industry standards and gain exposure to the best practices in the tech industry. The program offers a unique opportunity to not only enhance my technical skills but also to network and collaborate with like-minded individuals. By interacting with various groups of professionals and peers with a diverse range of skills, I want to immerse myself in different tech spaces, learn from people and improving my skill set. AltSchool Africa provides the ideal environment to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical, real-world applications, helping me iron out my approach to both front-end and backend engineering with a more professional perspective
